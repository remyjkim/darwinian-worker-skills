# inspect-minds

## Purpose

Explain Darwinian Minds state without mutating anything. Use `status`, `doctor`,
card-status provenance, store health, and extension status surfaces to answer
what is active and why. Use write dry-runs only when the user asks what would
be materialized, including hook-consent warnings or optional card MCP servers.

Requires `drwn` on PATH. Scope is project, read-only. Blast radius is none.

## Procedure

1. Read current state with `drwn status --json`.
2. If the user named a specific skill, MCP server, extension, target, or card,
   run `drwn status --why "<name>"`.
3. If the user asks for a full explanation, run `drwn status --explain`.
4. Run `drwn doctor --json` to surface drift, stale state, or broken symlinks.
5. Run `drwn card status --explain` to surface card-level provenance.
6. Run `drwn mind list --json` when the user asks about minds, active stack
   behavior, or why a Mind Card is or is not projected.
7. Inspect generated mind artifacts when relevant:
   `.agents/drwn/generated/minds.json`, per-mind
   `.agents/drwn/generated/minds/<scope>/<name>/mind.json`, and composed
   `.agents/drwn/generated/mind/mind.json`.
   Explain that absent `activeMinds` means all installed cards are active,
   while explicit `activeMinds: []` means no composed mind should exist.
8. Run `drwn store status --json` to surface store health and legacy-layout
   detection.
9. If the user named a published card, run `drwn card show <ref> --json` and
   summarize bundled skills, MCP servers, and `hookPolicies`.
10. If the user asks what a write would do, run `drwn write --dry-run --json`
   and summarize `changes`, `warnings`, and `optionalMcpReport` without
   writing anything.
11. If the user mentioned an extension, run `drwn extensions status <name> --json`
   and `drwn extensions doctor <name> --json`.
12. Summarize findings in prose. If a repair is needed, direct the user to
   `repair-minds` rather than fixing anything here.

## User-Ask Points

None. This skill is intentionally read-only.

If the user asks to fix something, stop and redirect to `repair-minds`.

## Wraps

`drwn status --json`, `drwn status --why`, `drwn status --explain`,
`drwn doctor --json`, `drwn card status --explain`, `drwn store status --json`,
`drwn mind list --json`, `drwn card show --json`,
`drwn write --dry-run --json`,
`drwn extensions status --json`, `drwn extensions doctor --json`

## Scope

Project and machine inspection only. No mutations.

## Failure Modes

- Not in a drwn project: say so plainly and suggest `bootstrap-project`.
- No provenance for `--why`: explain that the named item is not active in the
  current project's mind state.
- Legacy layout detected: flag it loudly and point to `repair-minds`.
- Hook or optional MCP warnings in a write dry-run: explain the impact and point
  to `apply-mind-card` or `materialize-minds`; do not fix them here.
- `activeMinds: []` with no `.agents/drwn/generated/mind/`: report as expected,
  not drift.
